EECS 22 Assignment 4 Text File
	This assignment is based on assignment 3 which is to perform different Digital Image Processing operations on an image given by the class. However, our goal in this assignment is to practice the use of dynamic memory allocation of the image. In order to do so, we make use of 1-dimensional pointers instead of 2-dimensional arrays to store the R, G, and B values, as well as change every operation we have so far in the last two assignments in accordance to the use of pointers. Also, we have to implement 4 new DIP operations: Crop, Resize, Brightness and Contrast, and Watermark in this new assignment. 
	Note: I have been experiencing issues regarding the connectivity between my computer and the EECS servers. This issue has been ongoing since 5pm on 11/21/17, and thus I wasn’t able to debug the code I made. I have already consulted with Professor Doemer, Professor Dang, and OIT regarding this issue. This issue would be resolved after Thanksgiving. Thank you.
