This assignment is an extension of the second DIP
assignment we did previously. In addition to the old 
functions the second DIP assignment has, we have to 
add in three main functions and one function as bonus: 
"Noise", "Sharpen", "Posterize", and "Motion Blur". For 
the Noise function, we just have to use a random number
generator to generate indices of the pixels on the image,
and change the color of those pixels to white color.
As for the "Sharpen" function, it's similar to the 
"Edge" function we did in the second assignment, but
we replace 8 with 9. Lastly, for the "Posterize"
function, we were supposed to make the image look more 
like a poster by amplifying the intensities of the RGB
colors in the original image.
